// From Celsius to Fahrenheit degrees
// Write a program that asks for a temperature in Celsius degrees, then displays it in Fahrenheit degrees. The conversion between scales is given by the formula: [°F] = [°C] x 9/5 + 32.

let temp = prompt('What is the temperature in Celcius?')

let fahrenheit = (temp * 9/5) + 32

console.log(fahrenheit)
