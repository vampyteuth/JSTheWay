// Variable swapping
// Observe the following program.
// Add the necessary code to swap the values of variables number1 and number2.
// T> This exercise has several valid solutions. You may use more than two variables to solve it.
let number1 = 5;
let number2 = 3;
let actual1= number1
number1=number2
number2=actual1
console.log(number1); // Should show 3
console.log(number2); // Should show 5
