// Write a program that shows all numbers between 1 and 100 with the following exceptions:

// It shows "Fizz" instead if the number is divisible by 3.

// It shows "Buzz" instead if the number is divisible by 5 and not by 3.

// When it's done, improve it so that the program shows "FizzBuzz" instead for numbers divisible both by 3 and by 5.
